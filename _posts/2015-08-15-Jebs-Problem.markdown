While Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are often seen as the inevitable nominees for their parties, Hillary Clinton is the only one of the two was there is any certainty of becoming the nomination. The reason why Hillary Clinton can count on the nomination is because she is seen as the most likely candidate to defeat the Republican nominee this means that at least 39% of caucus-goers will likely vote for here. In contrast, while 38% of Republican caucus say defeating the democratic nominee.

### Breitbart:

> Of course, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney—the 2012 nominee—failed to turn out the Republican base in the 2012 election with most estimates saying at least 5 million conservatives stayed home.

The feeling that Mitt Romney lost for being too moderate is a deeply held thought in many of the grassroots activists that make up the Tea Party, Very Conservative, and Born Again Christians coalitions. This has left the Republican primary somewhat of a mystery because with no clear frontrunner against Hillary the next way to determine who is the most likely to win would be based off of fundraising, but this has also changed.

### NY Times:

> And candidates like Mr. Cruz, Bobby Jindal or Rand Paul need not cater to mainline donors and fund-raisers, whose allegiance has been a deciding factor with almost every Republican nomination of the last three decades. Instead, they can combine grass-roots fund-raising online with a few large checks from conservative billionaires, amassing enough to be competitive.

Thanks to Super PACs more candidates will be able to keep going and unlike 2012 where only Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney had Super PAC this time it is a requirement for everyone. While Jeb Bush still hasn’t released his fundraising totals no one will be scared off by them because as everybody has pointed out there is no reason not to run.
